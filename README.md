## Working Principle of Robot
When robot start front servo down itself 90 degrees and back wheels works. When the robot's front wheels come to the step, front servo pull itself and back servo going down. After that with the help of tail wheels and front wheels robot moves on. After a delay back servo go up and front servo is making 90 degree again.
