## MUFERobotics Stair Climber Robot for ITURO 2019
As we tried to climb stair in ITURO 2018 we confornt a problem due to Servo Motor. We changed the Servo motor and make optimization in the code.

Participants:

    Rıdvan San
    Akın Can Okyay
    Cem Erciyas
    Hüseyin Erbayraktar
## Materials We Used    
    1 Arduino Mega 2560
    3 L298N Motor Driver
    3 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
    2 Servo Motor
    6 DC Motor
## Working Principle of Robot

## Code Explaining
We preferred to use one function for one device. e.g. one Ultrasonic Sensor Method for all Ultrasonic Sensors.
Thats why we divided the robot into parts.
